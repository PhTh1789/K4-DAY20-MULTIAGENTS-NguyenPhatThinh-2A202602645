description: Use when parsing logs into structured error reports with canonical fields, metadata, or ordering requirements.
---
- Normalize service names and other categorical fields exactly as specified before aggregation or output.
- Convert timestamps to the required timezone and format before comparing or sorting them.
- Sort records explicitly by every required key in the specified order; do not rely on input order.
- Include all required top-level metadata and schema-version fields, even when record parsing succeeds.
- Preserve relevant log details, such as exception information and repetition counts, in their designated fields.
- Validate the final output against the required schema and confirm canonical names and sort order.
